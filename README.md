These are the portions of Uthgard (https://uthgard.org) - a Dawn Of Light freeshard - that have been open-sourced by me under GPL for public use. Use at your own risk.

Be aware that this code will not work with the current Dawn of Light head without major modifications; there is no easy integration available.
